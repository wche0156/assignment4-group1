Our group data sources: we downloaded the data csv files from a website called "our world in data", and these data are all related to the topic of diet composition.

Purposeï¼šThere is a Chinese proverb which says that man is iron, rice is steel, if you don't eat, you will be hungry. As we all know, food is very important and we cannot live without grains, animal protein, fats and other elements. Conversely, an unhealthy diet increases the likelihood of developing diabetes, obesity, cancer and other diseases. We chose to study this topic because it is so relevant to our lives.

Research question: 
1.How the proportion of various food groups in the Australian diet changed over time?
2.How the calories from animal protein varies around the world?
3.In Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States, which country has the relatively best linear model of the relationship between overweight or obese and caloric supply since 2000?
4.How much FAO i.e. Fats Animal Oil is in Vegetable Oil in Australia that is consumed by people in different year?
5.Comparing the FAO in maize, rice and wheat over the years in single figure to see that they all decreased, increased or differs?
6.Distribution of FAO in Animal Fat and Vegetable Oil against the averages and skewness.
7.Finding the relation between two variables i.e. Year and FAO in Animal Fat.
